## Notes

I spent about 4 hours on this assessment. I wish I had a little more time but I have to leave for the weekend so this is all I could do for now.

I chose NEXT.js because I've had experience with it and it has a lot of features like file base routing out of the box that will help with a timed assessment. It also offers backend capability so if I had been faster I would have had the option.

I spent most of my time learning how to use the react-table library to render the table. It is a nice library that comes with a lot of functionality out of the box like the sorting that's being done in this app. So it was nice to learn something new for the assessment.

I would like to explore more of its features if I had the time. There are pagination features that I've yet to use. And there are search functionality built in also.

I would also like to explore more on displaying all the information instead of the selected fews that I have chosen.

I would also like to spend more time with styling. Some of the table items could have used some hover card feature to explain to the user in more details what it means.

Thank you so much for the opportunity and I look forward to discussing my solutions with you.
